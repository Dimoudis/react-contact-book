◉ React Contact Book

◉ Overview
This is a Contact Book application built with React. It allows users to add and delete contacts dynamically. 
Each contact contains a name, email, and phone number. 
The app demonstrates fundamental React concepts such as state management, JSX, and array manipulation.

◉ Features
- Display a list of contacts with their name, email, and phone.
- Add a new contact using the "Add New Contact" button.
- Delete contacts:
  - Each contact has a delete button (dynamic delete).
  - A separate delete button can remove a contact by a specific email (hard-coded).
